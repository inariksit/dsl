/* like, for example ...

append "poo" forEach [Foo, Bar, Baz]

is equivalent to, in some other languages,

    [Foo, Bar, Baz].map(x=>x+"poo")
or
    (++ "poo") <$> [foo, bar, baz]

so we can sneak that in to our language too, just with lots of
syntactic sugar so the "business developers" don't notice we're doing
a list comprehension
